# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house selling prices aiming to empower informed decisions for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the selling price of houses. The model is trained on historical data containing information about houses and their corresponding selling prices. The predicted prices are the numeric values falling within a predefined range that reflects the typical house prices in the target region.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to create a reliable tool that can estimate the selling price of a house based on its characteristics and market trends. This information can be valuable for various stakeholders in the real estate market, including:

Homeowners: Get a more informed estimate of their property's potential selling price.
Potential buyers: Gain insights into the fair market value of houses they are considering purchasing.
Real estate agents: Enhance their ability to price houses competitively and provide data-driven recommendations to their clients.
Investors: Develop data-driven strategies for property selection and valuation.
By providing accurate and timely price predictions, this model can contribute to increased transparency and efficiency within the real estate market.
